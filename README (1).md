# SQL Data Warehouse Design

## Overview
This project involves designing a scalable SQL-based data warehouse to analyze sales data. It provides insights into regional performance, product-wise sales, and monthly trends.

## Features
- **Schema Design**: Includes tables for Regions, Products, and Sales.
- **Sales Analysis**:
  - Total sales by region.
  - Top-performing products.
  - Monthly sales trends.
  - Product performance by region.

## How to Use
1. Run the `schema.sql` script to create the database and tables.
2. Insert sample data into the tables (provided in `schema.sql`).
3. Use the queries in `queries.sql` to perform sales analysis.

## Sample Insights
- Identify regions with the highest sales.
- Analyze the most profitable products.
- Understand sales trends over time.

## Requirements
- SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any compatible database system).

## Files
- `schema.sql`: SQL script for creating the database schema and inserting sample data.
- `queries.sql`: SQL queries for sales analysis.
